# Complex_Number_c-
geometry problems using complex number in c++
all arithmetic operations which can be done on complex number , now can easily be done using complex class in c++
exapmle : to add two complex number :
typedef<complex> P;
P a={4,3};
P b={5,7};
P add=a+b;
add will store the addition of complex number a and b
